h1. SplatCamp aka *Camp

This project is meant to be your one stop shop for running your BarCamp, HealthCamp, FashionCamp, NewsInnovationCamp, etc. Hence the name *Camp.

It started off as an online live schedule app where you can load in sessions as people build it the morning of your event.  With the addition of the following features we hope to build out a tool to support all your camping needs:
* Event registration
* Blog/wiki for maintaining the event's content
* The event schedule with some additional features
* Panel suggestions and voting prior to the event
* Twitter, Flickr, etc. integration


h2. This project is a fork of BaseJumper

We're using this as a starting point.  For more BaseJumper info see the github page http://github.com/gdagley/basejumper
